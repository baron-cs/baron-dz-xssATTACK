💥 Tool Details: BARON v5.2BARON v5.2 (implemented in algeria.py) is a dedicated, automated Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability checker that utilizes Selenium WebDriver to actively test web application parameters. By executing payloads in a real, headless browser environment, it is highly effective at detecting reflected XSS vulnerabilities, including those that require user interaction (like clicking a link or a button).1. 🎯 FeaturesActive Browser Testing: Uses headless Chrome (via Selenium) to execute payloads and confirm XSS by detecting live JavaScript alert(), confirm(), or prompt() pop-ups.Comprehensive Encoding: Automatically generates and tests multiple encoded variations (URL, Double/Triple URL, Hex/HTML Entity, Mixed Case) to bypass common filters.Interaction Emulation: Attempts to click interactive elements (links with "CLICK" or submit buttons) if the payload requires it.File Input Support: Can load a custom list of payloads from a file or use its integrated defaults.Parameterized Testing: Automatically identifies and iterates through every query parameter found in the input URL.2. 💻 Requirements & InstallationA. Python DependenciesInstall the required Python packages using pip:Bashpip install selenium colorama urllib3
B. Chrome DriverThe tool requires the Chromium/Chrome web driver (chromedriver):Install Google Chrome or Chromium.Install chromedriver: Ensure the chromedriver executable matches your browser version and is accessible on your system path.Update Configuration: You must verify and potentially update the CHROME_DRIVER_PATH variable inside the algeria.py script to the correct location for your system.Python# In algeria.py
CHROME_DRIVER_PATH = "/usr/bin/chromedriver"  # << UPDATE THIS PATH IF NEEDED
3. 🚀 UsageExecute the script directly from your terminal using the correct file name:Bashpython algeria.py
The tool will display its logo and then prompt you for three inputs:StepPromptDescription1.Enter Base URLThe target URL. Must include query parameters (e.g., https://example.com/search?q=&page=1).2.Payloads File NamePath to a file containing one payload per line. Leave blank to use the integrated default payloads.3.Select ModeChoose which payloads to test: **(A)**ll (Base + Encoded), **(B)**ase Only, or **(E)**ncoded Only.4. 🛠️ Integrated Default PayloadsIf you choose not to provide a file, BARON uses the following common list of pop-up payloads:<script>alert(document.domain)</script>"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>"><svg onload=alert(1)>javascript:alert(1)"></a><a href="javascript:alert(1)">CLICK</a><iframe srcdoc='<script>alert(1)</script>'>
